# CS340 Database Course

#### _Class Group Project for Sarah Turner and Carrie Davis_

## Project Overview: 

This database maps out the characters of the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Television Series that aired from 2010 - 2014. [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_characters) .
[Fandom page"](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic_Wiki )The focus is on this particular cast of fun and cute characters. In this series the show focuses on diverse personalities with complex relatable issues. These ponies come from different groups, cities in different regions, and can be of different types. Think of a child friendly, relatable game of thrones minus genocide. Many characters have occupations or multiple occupations throughout the Equestria empire. This is all flexible
as the fun drama of pony life plays out. The character list is almost exhaustible and this database will allow users to add characters to complete the character list. The database will allow characters to be filtered/selected by city, group, type, character and occupation.

The complexity and ability to build relationships between entities makes this a good candidate for a
database project.
